# RandomCliqueComplexes_ICML2018

### About
This is a source code for our [ICML 2018](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2018) paper: [Solving Partial Assignment Problems using Random Clique Complexes](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/sharma18a).

### Requirements
This code is developed in 
```
MATLAB R2017b
```
### Dataset
We used five different datasets for evaluation. The dataset names are:
- CMU House
- CMU Hotel
- Car
- Bike
- Butterfly
- Magazine
- Building
- Book

### Usage
To run the matching model to generate results for "House" dataset for pairwise matching of 111 images, run:
```
main.m
```
## **Example of higher order matchings**
